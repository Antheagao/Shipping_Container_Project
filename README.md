# Project Overview
This project was created for our ***Project in CS: Artificial Intelligent Systems***. 

Our project entails a program, ran on an IDE, that provides the optimal order of operations to *onload*/*offload* and *balance* containers on a ship. 

The program takes a manifest file as input, which is set to a specific format that contains the *(X,Y) coordinates*, *weight (kg)*, and *container label*/*status*. 

The program is meant to be used for shipping container movements at shipping docks, thus it comes featured with 
* **user sign-in/sign-out**
* **optimal order of operations list for the crane operator**
* **estimated time of completion to move all shipping containers**
* **ASCII text-art to illustrate the ship's dock, and illustrate each shipping container movement**
* **option to add comments to the log file, which is keeping track of user's actions (to be sent to management of whomever wishes to use the program)**
* **ability to balance the weight of the ship, following Maritime Law, in the quickest time**
* **ability to offload a specific shipping container, given the container's label, using optimal order of operations**
